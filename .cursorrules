# UCID App Development Rules
# Cursor's Operating System - Under 100 lines, Crystal Clear

## Project Context
- Industrial Design career exploration app for UC students
- React + TypeScript + Vite + North Star design system
- Focus: Student discovery through conversation → career guidance
- Target: 18-year-olds exploring Industrial Design careers

## Code Patterns
- Functional components with hooks (no class components)
- TypeScript strict mode - all props/interfaces defined
- North Star CSS variables: --uc-primary, --uc-space-4, --uc-text-xl
- Error boundaries for all major components
- localStorage for data persistence

## File Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (VideoIntroduction.tsx)
- Styles: kebab-case (north-star-system.css)
- Types: camelCase interfaces (ConversationContext)
- Services: camelCase (llmService.ts)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

## Component Structure
```typescript
// 1. Imports (React, hooks, types, services)
// 2. Interface definitions
// 3. Component function
// 4. State declarations
// 5. useEffect hooks
// 6. Event handlers
// 7. Render return
// 8. Export default
```

## Testing Strategy
- Write tests first, then implementation
- Test user journeys, not implementation details
- Mock external dependencies (localStorage, navigation)
- Use descriptive test names that explain behavior

## AI Behavior Rules
- Always consider full user journey (video → conversation → forms → career)
- Prioritize accessibility and performance
- Suggest improvements, don't just fix bugs
- Maintain North Star design system consistency
- Cache user data appropriately

## Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for video loading
- Clear error messages for users
- Console logging for debugging
- No silent failures

## Performance
- Lazy load components when possible
- Optimize images and videos
- Minimize bundle size
- Fast page transitions

## Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast support
- Focus indicators

## Data Flow
- Conversation cache → localStorage
- Interest patterns → career suggestions
- Form data → career exploration
- Visual inspiration → engagement

## Dependencies
- React 18+ with hooks
- TypeScript 5+
- Vite 4+
- React Router v6
- Framer Motion for animations

## Version Control
- Commit messages: "feat:", "fix:", "docs:", "test:"
- Feature branches for new functionality
- PR reviews required for main branch
