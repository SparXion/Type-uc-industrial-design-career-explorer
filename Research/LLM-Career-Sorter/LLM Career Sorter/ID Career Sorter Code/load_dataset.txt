**Summary**: `load_dataset.cypher` is a Cypher script that initializes the `idcareersorter` Neo4j database for the Industrial Design Career Sorter. It clears existing data, creates 35 `Interest` nodes (e.g., “Drawing Spaceships”), 28 `Skill` nodes (e.g., “Concept Art”), and 25 `Role` nodes (e.g., “Concept Designer”), and establishes relationships: `ADJACENT_TO` (between interests, weight 0.8), `DEVELOPS` (interests to skills, weight 0.9), and `LEADS_TO` (skills to roles). The script includes verification queries to confirm the database structure (88 nodes, relationships, and “Concept Art” presence). It was executed in Neo4j Browser to populate the database for `prototype.py`.
