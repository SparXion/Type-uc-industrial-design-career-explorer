## Notes on Dataset
- **Adjacencies**: Interests are linked based on shared traits (e.g., LEGO and model kits share spatial reasoning and prototyping). Weights (e.g., 0.8 for high similarity) can be assigned in the graph database.
- **ID Skills**: Each interest maps to one or more skills with a relevance score (e.g., LEGO → 3D modeling, score = 0.9).
- **ID Roles**: Skills lead to roles, forming pathways (e.g., 3D modeling → product designer).
- **Scalability**: The dataset can be expanded by adding more interests (e.g., “collecting rocks and designing displays” or “making homemade soap”) and computing their adjacencies using NLP embeddings.
- **LLM Inspiration**: Interests are embeddable as vectors (e.g., using Sentence-BERT) to compute similarities for novel inputs (e.g., “I loved making sandcastles” → constructing forts).

## Example Usage in Sorter
- **Input**: “I loved drawing spaceships and building with LEGO.”
  - **Matches**: Drawing spaceships → sketching, visual communication; LEGO → 3D modeling, prototyping.
  - **Output**: “Your interests suggest skills in sketching and 3D modeling, ideal for roles like concept designer or product designer. Explore CAD software and prototyping courses.”
- **Input**: “I made puppets and played video games.”
  - **Matches**: Puppets → storytelling, material exploration; video games → UX/UI design, systems design.
  - **Output**: “Your puppet-making indicates storytelling skills, and video games suggest UX/UI design. Consider roles like toy designer or interaction designer. Try courses in material science or UX design.”
