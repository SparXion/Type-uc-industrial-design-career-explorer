# UCID App - New APP interface ideas - Vibe

 

Here is a vision for an interface. Can you help me extract the key points in simple terms organized in a procedural order followed by a list of assets that will need to be generated?
If I can imagine this for a second... 
THIS WILL BE A VISUAL/INTERACTIVE ADVENTURE into the world of Industrial Design.
The student is welcomed by an exciting animation flashing all the cool assets available in the Industrial Design Ecosystem. 
The student is then greeted by a welcome page and an invitation to create a profile with a name and password or a login if they already have a username.
There is a simple and brief explanation of the app and how to use it. REally simple. "Here's how it works - input your interests, what you like doing and what you're good at and we will match it with some suggestions for possible career paths. Ready to get started?"
The next interface will be the beginning of a three(?) step process. This would be a combination of Verbal and Visual stimulus? The KEY is to give them a kickstart with some possible options (a blank slate is difficult to fill)
Step 1: Interests. an invitation to think of all the things they had fun doing as kids or what they are currently doing they find fun and interesting. 
Step 2: Creative Outlets. An invitation to share hobbies or talents they have developed since they were children as well as what they are doing now. The idea is to help them identify overt talents or implicit talents they have not yet recognized. Also, the purpose is to identify talents that may not necessarily be recognized as relevant to Industrial design - Like robotics programming or web development.
Step 3: Skills. An image emerges from their inputs. Not literally. But, an idea emerges of some potential SKILLS they could build on combining their INTERESTS with their TALENTS.
NOW WHAT?
There is an option to turn the machine on. It could be like a vortex time portal animation. It's a virtual interactive adventure for about 10 minutes? 20 minutes? Full of amazing imagery of art created by leading professionals and students. Embedded videos? showcasing people at work DOING the things?
There should be plenty of content related to each avenue of possible career paths. How do we link the content? I kind of want it sourced by the AI, but maybe it is just stored in a database and revealed? I need to think about this some more.
Grok - with this summary below, can you eliminate the text only inputs from the interface design? this should be visual.
OOH - an idea - give them a practice project? using AI to create a practice project that aligns with their skills? something really simple. The engine behind it basically does it for you, but you have SOME input. <-- put a box around this and tag it.
The student inputs some ideas about what they are interested in, after a few interactions, like 3-5, the AI should start having an idea of some options for career paths. I think I'd like the student to be able to read them as they become available in the window they are inputting their ideas. maybe the screen morphs a little to include some option selections for careers. They can continue to input ideas/thoughts and fortify the AI's suggestions or choose to explore a career path. It should all be seamless and multi directional. fluid forward or backwards. The student can affect the suggested results with further inputs. The career paths could be sort of faded at first and get stronger/more bold visually as the AI gains certainty with further inputs. Let's say the student inputs some ideas in the first text box. after 3-5 inputs, the screen morphs where the input box animates to the left and some cool looking semi transparent boxes appear, maybe 3 at variable transparencies depending on strength of connection(?). The student can choose to continue inputting ideas in the original box or select a faded/semi transparent career suggestion leading them to either the mind map or grid. As they input more ideas in the original box, the 3 career suggestions either fade further or get stronger/brighter less transparent, or change altogether depending on the input results. Open app, register, greeted by a prompt for the user to input ideas about interests (to be worked out). Student inputs ideas after an interaction stream like we have already discussed (don't change anything we already agreed on, I can't remember). As the student reaches the 3-5 input threshold, the screen changes where the input box seamlessly moves to the left of the screen, staying active. As the box moves to the left in a smooth transition, 3 new "results" boxes in an animated seamless fashion on the right of the screen. They may appear faded/semi transparent to represent strength of relevance. A hover over any one of these three faded boxes will animate with scale and slight decreased transparency (this transparency only indicates hover over, separate from result/relevance strength). As the student is hovered over one fo the 3 new boxes, he is able to click it to activate a new page --> either a mind map or grid. The transition should move left to right in a seamless way across the screen. This needs to be a fluid experience as opposed to clicking "pages". There will be a back button that can return them to the inptu box + 3 results. When they are in this mind map or grid, they are free to select any box and dig into the rabbit holes. Lets say this: 1. landing page: with registration(?) like you might register for a dating site? Username/Password? (i don't know). 2. Second Page: is the initial prompt page asking for interests/talents. 3. Third Page: initial prompt moves left and reveals 3 potential career paths for exploration. 4: Fourth page is a smooth transition to either grid or mind map. 5. Fifth page is any box clicked on the grid or mindmap. this could reveal 2-3 more layers of mind maps/grids. All updated live by the AI and with back arrows. This should all feel like one "conversation" as they progress between "pages". This is like those websites that have smooth transitions as you move the mouse? I don't know how to describe it, but the screen should have smooth transitions.
