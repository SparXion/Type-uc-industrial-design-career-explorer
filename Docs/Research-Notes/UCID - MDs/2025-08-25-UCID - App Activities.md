**Childhood Interests Leading to Industrial Design**
Precursor interests from childhood, grade school, and high school often spark creativity, problem-solving, and visualization skills essential for designing real/sci-fi items and manifestations. These build spatial awareness, storytelling, and hands-on experimentation.

These foster skills like ideation and prototyping, linking to ID careers via the app's student portal: Input interests via React form, process with Flask/NLP, store in MongoDB, display matches in grid/mind map.
